# ðŸ“Š Modern Portfolio Theory - Python Project

This project demonstrates the use of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to optimize asset allocation based on historical stock returns and risk. It calculates the efficient frontier**, portfolio risk vs return, and helps visualize how diversification can improve portfolio performance. The data from Yahoo Finance has been used to conduct the calculations.

Technologies Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- yfinance
- NumPy
- pandas
- datetime
- pypfopt
- Matplotlib


Key Features
- Calculates the optimal capital to be allocated for each stocks to maximise the sharpe ratio
- Plots the efficient frontier and compare it with the benchmark

File
- `Modern_Portfolio_Theory.ipynb` â€” Main notebook with all code and plots.

Concept
Modern Portfolio Theory is a mathematical framework for assembling a portfolio of assets such that the expected return is maximized for a given level of risk. This project demonstrates its principles using Python.
